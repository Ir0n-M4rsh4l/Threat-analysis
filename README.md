# Threat-analysis
IA threat analysis, APT identification and prediction of next techniques based on  MITTRE ATT&CK.

# MITTRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

## Data modeling

From the MITTRE ATT&CK dataset, we extracted usefull information that allowed us to know what is the probability for one group to use each technic and what is the probability for one technique,malware or tool to be used by each group.

# Threat analysis
We are able to make 2 predictions : the next technique in a cyber attack and the group that attacked.

## Prediction of the next technique
Based on the bayesian networks.

## Identification of the group
Based on the probability for a group to use specific tools, malwares and techniques.

# Conclusion
